Project 7
2/27/14

This project took me around 12 hours. It was moderately difficult, but I found it to be easier than the Assembler. I found
the textbook very useful, and I followed its guidelines for this assignment very closely. I did not have any collaborators
other than the instructor. Writing the code itself took a long time, but it was not hard at all for me. I read chapter 7
in the textbook a lot and had a very good understanding of what to do. The hardest part for me was debugging. I had very 
small errors in my Assembly code, which took me hours to fix. I went to Dr. Wakefield's office hours a lot, and he helped
me find my mistakes. Here are the guidelines for using the terminal to run my code.

1. open up terminal and cd into project called VMTranslator
2. call javac Main.java Parser.java CodeWriter.java
3. call java Main "pathname"
