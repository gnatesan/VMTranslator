Project 8
3/16/15

This project took me around 8 hours. It was moderately difficult, but I found it to be easier than part 1. This is probably because I kind of got more familiar with the virtual machine. I had no collaborators besides the instructor. Writing the code was not that bad. I just had a few small errors that it took me a while to debug. I am a lot more comfortable with hack assembly code after finishing the VM. Here are the guidelines for using the terminal to run my code. 

1. open up terminal and cd into project called VMTranslator, cd into src folder
2. call javac Main.java Parser.java CodeWriter.java
3. call java Main "Folder" "outputFileName"

	i.e. java Main StaticsTest StaticsTest (this looks in the StaticsTest folder and creates a file called StaticsTest.asm), the StaticsTest folder and FibonacciElement folder are in the src file so you can just type the folder name to access that directory
