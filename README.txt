1. open up terminal and cd into project called VMTranslator, cd into src folder
2. call javac Main.java Parser.java CodeWriter.java
3. call java Main "Folder" "outputFileName"

	i.e. java Main StaticsTest StaticsTest (this looks in the StaticsTest folder and creates a file called StaticsTest.asm), the StaticsTest folder and FibonacciElement folder are in the src file so you can just type the folder name to access that directory
